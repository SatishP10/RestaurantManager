# RestaurantManager
C++ code that manages a restaurant and (almost) all of its functions. 

Main:
The main method takes in user input (S to seat, O to order, C to clean table). These have to be done in cronoligical order (for example, a table can't order before being seated). It takes into to account the party size as there are limits to how many people the table can seat.
